# Frontend Build Output

This directory (`public/`) will contain the built frontend files after you run the setup script or build the frontend manually.

## When will this folder have files?

Run one of:
```bash
./setup-frontend.sh      # Builds frontend and copies here
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run build
cp -r dist ../backend-v2/public
```

## What goes here?

After building, the `public/` folder will contain:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file (entry point for SPA)
- `assets/` - JavaScript, CSS, images (hashed filenames for cache busting)
- Other static assets

## Structure

```
public/
├── index.html           ← Served for all SPA routes
├── assets/
│   ├── index-abc123.js  ← React app bundle (hashed)
│   ├── index-xyz789.css ← Styles (hashed)
│   └── logo-def456.svg  ← Images (hashed)
└── ...
```

## Important Notes

1. **Don't edit files here manually** - They're generated by the build process
2. **Commit this folder** if you want to version control builds (optional)
3. **Add to .gitignore** if you prefer building on deployment
4. **Cache busting** - Hashed filenames ensure fresh content is loaded

## Deployment

The backend serves all files in this folder. For production:

1. Build frontend: `npm run build` (from frontend/)
2. Copy to public: `cp -r dist ../backend-v2/public`
3. Deploy backend (entire `backend-v2` folder)
4. Backend serves frontend + API from same process

---

## Getting Started

From `backend-v2/` directory:

```bash
# Step 1: Build frontend and copy here
./setup-frontend.sh

# Step 2: Start backend (serves frontend + API)
npm run dev

# Step 3: Open browser
# http://localhost:3002
```

That's it! Frontend and API running from the same server.
